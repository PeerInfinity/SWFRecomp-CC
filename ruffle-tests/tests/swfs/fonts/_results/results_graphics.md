## Ruffle-Matched Tests

**1 tests promoted** — our diffs against Flash's `output.txt` are a proper subset of Ruffle's diffs against the same file (i.e. we are at least as good as Ruffle on every line of these tests). Each carries `known_failure = true` upstream with a sidecar `output.ruffle.txt`.

| # | Test | Our diffs | Ruffle diffs | Duration | Notes |
|---|------|-----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `device_font_no_ink` | 14 | 14 | 30.1s |  |

## Near-Passing Tests

Tests with output mismatch but >= 50% line match rate (low-hanging fruit).

**0 tests** within reach

No tests above 50% match threshold.

## Segfaults

No segfaults.

## Runtime Errors

No runtime errors.

## Timeouts

No timeouts.

## All Output Mismatches

**1 tests** with output mismatch, sorted by match rate (best first)

| # | Test | Match Rate | Matching/Total | Actual | Expected | Notes |
|---|------|------------|----------------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `embed_name_lookup` | 35.5% | 86/242 | 242 | 242 |  |
