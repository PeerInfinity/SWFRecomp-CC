# Deprecated Merge Documentation

These documents are **historical records** from the initial fork creation (October-November 2025).

## Why Deprecated?

These documents describe the process of:
1. Forking SWFRecomp and SWFModernRuntime from the main repositories
2. Creating `wasm-support` branches with string variable storage and WASM support
3. Merging those branches back to master

**All this work has already been incorporated** into the SWFRecomp-CC combined repository. The documents remain here as historical reference but are no longer actionable.
