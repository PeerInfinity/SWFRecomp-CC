NOTE: Opcode ActionNewMethod (0X53) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'new_method_swf_5':
    - Function objects as constructors - when method name is blank, spec requires object to be invoked as constructor function (requires DEFINE_FUNCTION/function object infrastructure)
    - User-defined constructor functions - only built-in constructors (Array, Object, Date, String, Number, Boolean) are supported; user-defined constructors require function object implementation
    - Proper 'this' binding for constructor calls - requires function object implementation with 'this' context support
    - Prototype chain for constructed objects - prototypes not yet implemented in object system
    - Constructor return value handling - spec requires discarding constructor return value and returning new object; not tested without function object support

Please address these missing features to complete the implementation.

When the opcode is fully complete, update test_info.json to set fully_implemented: true (or fully_implemented_no_graphics: true if graphics are the only missing piece).


Please read these files and follow their instructions:

SWFRecompDocs/prompts/pending/opcode-geturl2-0x9a.md

NOTE: Opcode ActionGetURL2 (0X9A) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'get_url2_swf_4':
    - HTTP client functionality - no actual GET/POST requests made
    - Variable encoding (x-www-form-urlencoded) - movie clip variables not sent with requests
    - Variable parsing from HTTP response - response not parsed into ActionScript variables
    - Setting variables in target scope - variables from response not set in timeline or sprite
    - SWF file downloading and loading - external SWF files not actually loaded
    - MovieClip/sprite management - sprite paths not resolved, no actual sprite loading
    - Browser window integration - URLs not opened in actual browser windows
    - Security sandbox enforcement - no cross-domain restrictions implemented

Please address these missing features to complete the implementation.

When the opcode is fully complete, update test_info.json to set fully_implemented: true (or fully_implemented_no_graphics: true if graphics are the only missing piece).
