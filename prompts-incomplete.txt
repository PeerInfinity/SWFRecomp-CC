NOTE: Opcode ActionCall (0X9E) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'call_swf_4':
    - Frame labels not supported (would require SWFRecomp to generate label->frame mapping)
    - Target path parsing not implemented (e.g., '/movieclip:frame')
    - Multi-MovieClip support not implemented (only main timeline supported)
    - Test coverage: need multi-frame test to verify actual frame execution

Please address these missing features to complete the implementation.

When the opcode is fully complete, update test_info.json to set fully_implemented: true (or fully_implemented_no_graphics: true if graphics are the only missing piece).

Please read these files and follow their instructions:
SWFRecompDocs/complete-implementation-guide.md
SWFRecompDocs/prompts/completed/opcode-enumerate-0x46.md

NOTE: Opcode ActionEnumerate (0X46) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'enumerate_swf_4':
    - Prototype chain enumeration - ASObject structure lacks prototype field, so inherited properties are not enumerated (required for full ActionScript compliance)
    - DontEnum property filtering - No mechanism to mark properties as non-enumerable per ECMA-262 standard (all properties are currently enumerated)
    - Slash-path/dot-path variable resolution - Spec mentions support for paths like '/path/to/obj' or 'obj.prop' but this is untested
    - Property enumeration metadata - No support for property attributes (enumerable, writable, configurable)

Please address these missing features to complete the implementation.

When the opcode is fully complete, update test_info.json to set fully_implemented: true (or fully_implemented_no_graphics: true if graphics are the only missing piece).

SWFRecompDocs/complete-implementation-guide.md
SWFRecompDocs/prompts/completed/opcode-new-method-0x53.md

NOTE: Opcode ActionNewMethod (0X53) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'new_method_swf_5':
    - Function objects as constructors - current implementation only supports string properties containing constructor names, not actual function objects
    - User-defined constructor functions - only built-in constructors (Array, Object, Date, String, Number, Boolean) are supported
    - Constructor return value handling - spec says constructor return value should be discarded and new object returned, but this isn't fully tested
    - Proper 'this' binding for constructor calls - requires full function object implementation
    - Prototype chain for constructed objects - advanced feature not implemented
    - String/Number/Boolean wrapper objects - constructors create objects but don't properly store wrapped primitive values
    - Test relies on variable system which has persistence issues, causing test to output 'undefined' instead of expected value

Please address these missing features to complete the implementation.

When the opcode is fully complete, update test_info.json to set fully_implemented: true (or fully_implemented_no_graphics: true if graphics are the only missing piece).

    - User-defined constructor functions not supported
    - Constructor function invocation with 'this' binding not implemented
    - Built-in constructors beyond Array and Object not implemented (Date, String, Number, Boolean, etc.)

NOTE: Opcode ActionTargetPath (0X45) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'target_path_swf_5':
    - MovieClip infrastructure not implemented - cannot return actual target paths for MovieClips
    - Display list hierarchy not available - cannot navigate or represent nested MovieClips
    - Path construction not implemented - returns placeholder '_root' instead of actual paths like '_root.mc1.mc2'
    - Test coverage: missing Object type test (would require INIT_OBJECT opcode support)

Please address these missing features to complete the implementation.

When the opcode is fully complete, update test_info.json to set fully_implemented: true (or fully_implemented_no_graphics: true if graphics are the only missing piece).

NOTE: Opcode ActionCastOp (0X2B) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'cast_op_swf_7':
    - Complete prototype chain testing requires DefineFunction for creating constructor functions
    - Interface implementation testing requires proper ImplementsOp setup
    - Successful cast test (matching prototype chain) not included due to test complexity
    - Test only validates failure cases and doesn't crash behavior, not successful cast scenarios

NOTE: Opcode ActionEquals2 (0X49) is marked as NOT fully implemented.

Documented missing features:
  From test 'equals2_swf_5':
    - Boolean type support not available in recompiler (cannot test true == 1, false == 0)
    - Null type support not available in recompiler (cannot test null == undefined, null == 0)
    - Additional edge case testing limited by test framework (NaN, Infinity, empty string tests would benefit from dedicated test files)
    - Object reference equality not tested (requires object creation support)

Please address these missing features to complete the implementation.

When the opcode is fully complete, update test_info.json to set fully_implemented: true (or fully_implemented_no_graphics: true if graphics are the only missing piece).

Documented missing features:
  From test 'extends_swf_7':
    - Constructor property not set correctly - Dog.prototype.constructor should equal Animal but comparison fails
    - Prototype chain traversal not implemented - GET_MEMBER only searches own properties, not __proto__ chain
    - instanceof opcode doesn't use prototype chain - always returns false (requires prototype chain support)
