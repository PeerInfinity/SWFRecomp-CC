    "implementation_notes": "The opcode is fully implemented with all core features: frame boundary validation (checks if target frame < total frames), timeline jump semantics (sets next_frame and manual_next_frame), stop/play state management (sets is_playing = 0 for gotoAndStop behavior), and integration with the MovieClip timeline system. Display list updates are automatic in graphics mode but not applicable in NO_GRAPHICS mode."
