DELETE2 is fully implemented per SWF specification: searches scope chain for named property, deletes if found in scope objects, returns false for var declarations (cannot delete), returns true for non-existent properties (Flash behavior).",

  "notes": "DELETE2 is fully implemented according to SWF spec. The opcode correctly: (1) searches the scope chain from innermost to outermost, (2) deletes properties from scope chain objects, (3) returns false when attempting to delete var declarations, (4) returns true for non-existent properties (Flash behavior). More comprehensive tests would require other opcodes (SetVariable, GetVariable, InitObject, WITH) to be fully functional."
